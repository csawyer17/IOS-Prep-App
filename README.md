*Prep App - by Chris Jerret, Lenny Litvak, and Cole Sawyer*

##OVERVIEW:

Prep App is a messaging/social networking app built for the purpose of
facilitating communication between students of a Prep class and between
students and teachers of a Prep class.

##SPECIFICATION:
        Prep App will include a way to register your student account as a
        member of any classes you are currently enrolled in as a Prep
        student.
        For any classes you are registered you will be able to enter a group
        message with your fellow students or with your teacher to ask questions
        about homework assignments, projects, or any other school-related
        topics.
        The app interfaces with our PHP and SQL based backend, which provides
        clean and scalible performance.
